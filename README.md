# Todo
- [x] Fix import system: we want pif to be imported as a package and so our transpiler does most of the work. The files in test should be able to run after that.
- [x] Implement `SecureBool`
- [x] Implement `SecureString`
- [x] Implement `SecurityException`
- [x] Fix `__isub__` onwards for `SecureNum`
- [x] Implement loops in analyzer
- [x] Fix `check_assignment` in `SecurityMonitor`.
- [x] Add some more documentation/comments in the code.
- [x] Add more tests.
- [x] Use argparse for better argument parsing for the transpiler.
- [x] Add ability to execute file immediately.
- [ ] Figure out exec file import errors.
